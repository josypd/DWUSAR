IMPOTANT: PLEASE READ BELOW!!!!!!!!!!!
Before test running the program, it is important
that you perform the following task as the
program will not run correctly:

1. Import the database - 
   Contained in the this directory is a file
   called 'das_db.sql'. This is the database
   structure and tables with the necessary
   test records. You must import this in your
   XAMPP installation and host the database.

2. The system does not run simply by
   connecting to localhost (127.0.0.1). Thus,
   a) Open the 'dbase_config.txt' file in the
      same directory.
   b) Change the current ip address '172.17.19.77'
      to YOUR OWN ip address. 
      The system will use this address as
      the host address to connect to the
      database. 

NOW THAT YOU HAVE DONE STEPS (1) AND (2) ABOVE...

3. Start the system/run the system from the file called
   'START_HERE.py'. 
   This file is the 'starting point' of the system. 

Thanks!
